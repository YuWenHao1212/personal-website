# You Get 4 Fresh Starts Every Year: The 12 Week Year Framework

Most people don't lack goals.

They lack execution.

​

That's from Brian Moran, author of [The 12 Week Year](https://www.amazon.com/12-Week-Year-Others-Months/dp/1118509234).

He calls it the **Knowing-Doing Gap**.

​

You know you should lose weight.

You know you should post more content.

You know you should start that side project.

​

But you don't.

​

Why?

​

---

## Why Annual Goals Fail: The Time Unit Problem

Moran argues the problem is the time unit itself.

​

When you have 12 months, your brain switches to power-saving mode.

There's always tomorrow. There's always next month.

​

This isn't laziness. It's human nature.

​

Parkinson's Law: Work expands to fill the time available.

​

Give yourself a year, and you'll take a year.

Give yourself 12 weeks, and you'll get it done in 12 weeks.

​

---

## How the 12 Week Year Method Works

The fix is simple:

​

**Treat 12 weeks as a full year.**

​

Not a quarter. Not a sprint.

A complete planning cycle—with the same weight as an annual plan.

​

12 weeks is short enough to create urgency.

12 weeks is long enough to accomplish something meaningful.

​

And you get 4 chances to start fresh every year.

​

---

## Three Effects of This Reframe

**First, the urgency becomes real.**

​

12 weeks = 84 days.

Wasting one week = wasting 1/12 of your "year."

That's like wasting a whole month in a traditional annual plan.

​

Still want to procrastinate?

​

**Second, failure becomes cheaper.**

​

Annual goals give you one shot. Mess up, wait until next year.

With 12-week cycles, you get 4 resets per year.

​

This actually makes you bolder.

​

**Third, feedback loops get faster.**

​

Annual plans take 12 months to evaluate.

12 Week Year gives you a score every week and a full review every 12 weeks.

​

You learn 4x faster.

## Three Core Concepts

Beyond the time frame, the book offers a complete execution system.

Here are the three concepts that stuck with me:

​

---

### Concept 1: Lead vs Lag Indicators — Track Actions, Not Outcomes

This one changed how I think about goals.

​

**Lag indicators** are results: revenue, weight, follower count.

**Lead indicators** are actions: calls made, posts published, workouts completed.

​

Most people obsess over Lag.

"Why haven't I lost weight yet?" "Why isn't my follower count growing?"

​

But you can't directly control Lag.

You can only control Lead—your actions.

​

Examples:

​

| Goal | Lag Indicator | Lead Indicator |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| Lose 10 kg | Weight | Work out 5x per week |
| Gain 500 followers | Follower count | Post 7x per week |
| Earn $1,000 | Revenue | Send 10 outreach emails per week |

​

12 Week Year teaches you to track Lead, not stress over Lag.

​

Do the right actions. Results follow.

​

### Concept 2: Weekly Execution Score — One Number That Keeps You Honest

Every week, ask yourself one question:

​

> "How much of what I planned did I actually complete?"

​

The formula is dead simple:

​

```
Score = Completed Actions / Planned Actions × 100%
```

​

- 85%+ = You're executing well
- Below 85% = Something's off

​

The power of this number? It's brutally honest.

​

You can tell yourself "I've been busy."

But the score doesn't lie.

​

Research in the book shows: execution scores correlate strongly with outcomes.

People who consistently hit 85%+ achieve their goals at dramatically higher rates.

​

---

### Concept 3: WAM (Weekly Accountability Meeting) — The Strategy Correction Point

Once a week. 15-20 minutes.

Find a partner or small group. Report to each other:

​

1. What was your execution score last week?
2. What's your plan for this week?
3. What needs to change?

​

Why does this matter?

​

Professor Gail Matthews' research found:

​

- Goals kept in your head: 43% success rate
- Written + shared + weekly check-ins: 76% success rate

​

Almost double.

​

It's not about being watched.

It's about how public commitment changes behavior.

​

But WAM isn't just for reporting scores.

It's for **strategy correction**.

​

If your Lead completion is consistently high but Lag isn't moving—

You need to ask: Did I pick the wrong Lead? Or is the strategy itself broken?

​

Say a salesperson makes 10 cold calls every day, but revenue stays flat.

Maybe it's not the call volume. Maybe it's the prospect list, the pitch, or even the product.

​

Or you work out 5 times a week, but your weight won't budge.

Maybe it's not the exercise. Maybe it's the diet.

​

WAM gives you a weekly chance to ask these questions.

Instead of grinding for three months before realizing you've been going the wrong direction.

## 12 Week Year Results: A 90-Day Case Study

This system has been validated by many.

​

**Nate, 30-year-old IT engineer + entrepreneur**

​

He combined 12 Week Year with a morning routine. After 90 days:

- Lost 14 pounds
- Saved 10 hours per week
- Grew revenue by 30%

​

His secret? 30 minutes of weekly review + targeting 85% execution.

​

More effective than any complex GTD system.

## My Twist: Wednesday Start

I've started implementing this myself.

​

I built a system called Cockpit to integrate the 12 Week Year into my workflow.

​

One adjustment: My week starts on **Wednesday**, not Monday.

​

Why?

​

Mondays and Tuesdays are usually eaten up by meetings and admin.

By the time you catch your breath, it's Wednesday and your week plan hasn't even started.

​

Making Wednesday "Day 1" means you start fresh with clear focus.

​

Here's my rhythm:

​

- **Wednesday**: New week begins, execute weekly tasks
- **Sunday**: Pre-review, check progress, two days left to catch up
- **Tuesday**: WAM day, calculate score, plan next week

​

This way, if I have time on the weekend, I can push a bit harder.

Unlike the Monday-start model where Friday feels like "eh, this week's already lost."

​

I'm only 10 days into my first 12-week cycle.

Already completed things I'd planned for Week 2.

​

Not because I'm working harder.

Because the time scale changed, and urgency kicked in.

​

---

## Final Thought

Back to where we started:

​

> "Most people don't lack goals. They lack execution."

​

12 Week Year isn't about working harder.

It's a system:

​

- Shorter time frame creates real urgency
- Lead indicators keep you focused on what you control
- Weekly scoring leaves no room to hide
- WAM keeps your strategy on track

​

You get 4 fresh starts every year.

​

Give it a shot.
