faq:
  - question: "Do Skills change OpenClaw's permissions?"
    answer: "No. Skills are just instruction manuals. Actual capabilities are controlled by tools.allow."
  - question: "Can the 1password Skill read all my passwords?"
    answer: "Yes. Once authorized, it has access to your entire vault — whatever you've stored, it can read."
  - question: "How do I revoke OpenClaw's Google access?"
    answer: "Google Account → Security → Third-party apps with account access → Find gog → Remove access."
  - question: "Are third-party Skills on ClawHub safe?"
    answer: "Don't assume they are. Always review the GitHub repo before installing. See our security guide for a detailed review checklist."
  - question: "What's the difference between OpenClaw and ChatGPT?"
    answer: "ChatGPT is a chat tool. OpenClaw is an agent. The difference is what happens after the conversation: ChatGPT can only talk to you, while OpenClaw can act — search the web, read and write files, manage your calendar, draft email replies, and push notifications to your phone."
  - question: "How to automate tasks with AI using OpenClaw?"
    answer: "Combine the cron tool (scheduling) with the message tool (push notifications). OpenClaw can run tasks on a schedule and push results to Telegram, Discord, or Slack. Common use cases: daily briefings, email triage, CI/CD monitoring, and content research."
  - question: "Can I use OpenClaw without coding?"
    answer: "Day-to-day usage requires no coding — just talk to it in natural language. But installation and configuration have a learning curve. Using an AI CLI tool like Claude Code to assist with setup can save significant time."

You've installed OpenClaw. Now what?

Tools are scattered across different docs. Skills auto-load by default — some are already active and you don't even know it. Enable everything and you're exposed. Disable everything and you've wasted the install. Piecing together the full picture from docs and source code takes real effort.

This is my research notes after setting up OpenClaw — what each of the 25 Tools and 53 official bundled Skills does, whether to enable it, how I configured mine, and why. Security analysis is covered in the <a href="/en/blog/2026-02-04-is-openclaw-safe-security-guide" target="_blank">security guide</a>. This article focuses on what each Tool and Skill does and how to configure them for your needs.

(There are 3,000+ third-party Skills on ClawHub — those are outside the scope of this guide.)

---

## First: Understand the Difference Between Tools and Skills

Many people confuse these two. It's actually straightforward.

**Tools are organs** — they determine whether OpenClaw *can* do something. `read` and `write` let it access files, `exec` lets it run system commands, `web_search` lets it search like Google, `web_fetch` lets it read web pages, `browser` lets it interact with pages (click buttons, fill forms, take screenshots). Without a Tool enabled, it's like having no hands — nothing gets done.

**Skills are textbooks** — they teach OpenClaw *how to combine Tools* to accomplish tasks. `gog` teaches it how to use Google Workspace for email and calendar, `obsidian` teaches it how to organize notes, `github` teaches it how to work with repos, `slack` teaches it how to send messages to channels. The 53 official Skills cover notes, email, social media, development, smart home, and more.

Does installing a Skill give OpenClaw new permissions? **No.**

Example: You install the `obsidian` Skill. OpenClaw now knows how to organize notes — but without the `write` Tool enabled, it can't write files at all. Skills are manuals. The real switches are in Tools.

For OpenClaw to actually do something via a Skill, three conditions must be met. Take "read your Gmail" as an example:

1. **Configuration**: Did you allow OpenClaw to run commands? (Without `exec`, it can't even launch a program)
2. **Installation**: Is the `gog` bridge tool installed on the machine? (Without it, OpenClaw knows what to do but can't connect to Google)
3. **Authorization**: Did you log into your Google account and grant access? (Without authorization, Google won't let it in)

All three are required. Skills are manuals — whether something actually works depends on these three conditions.

## The Concentric Circle Architecture: Core to Periphery

Listing all 25 Tools and 53 Skills flat would be overwhelming. I organize them in concentric circles:

- **Layer 1 — Core Capabilities (8 Tools)**: File access, command execution, web access. Almost everyone enables these.
- **Layer 2 — Advanced Capabilities (17 Tools)**: Browser control, memory, multi-session, automation. Enable as needed.
- **Layer 3 — Knowledge Layer (53 Skills)**: Teaches OpenClaw to work with Google, Obsidian, Slack, etc. Install what you use.

![OpenClaw concentric circle architecture: Layer 1 core tools (read, write, exec), Layer 2 advanced tools (browser, memory, automation), Layer 3 knowledge layer with 53 skills grouped by category](/images/blog/openclaw-tools-skills-tutorial/openclaw-tools-skills-architecture.webp)

---

## Layer 1: Core Capabilities (8 Tools)

These 8 Tools are OpenClaw's foundation. With only these enabled, OpenClaw is reactive — you ask, it responds. It can read files, run commands, and search the web, but it won't remember your preferences across sessions or proactively push you notifications. What turns OpenClaw from a "chatbot" into an "assistant" is Layer 2. But without Layer 1, Layer 2 can't function.

### File Operations: read, write, edit, apply_patch

`read` is read-only. `write` and `edit` can modify files, `apply_patch` applies code changes. These four are fundamental — most people enable all of them.

### Execution & Process Management: exec, process

`exec` lets OpenClaw run any shell command — install packages, run scripts, manage the system. "Any" is the key word: it can install dependencies for you, but it can also `rm -rf` your entire machine. Without `exec`, most tasks fail. With `exec` and no safeguards, you've handed over root access.

That's why I strongly recommend enabling approval alongside `exec` — every command is shown to you first, and only runs after you confirm:

```json
{
  "approvals": {
    "exec": { "enabled": true }
  }
}
```

Is it annoying? Honestly, yes. But it's the most basic protection — if the AI ever misjudges or gets hit by a Prompt Injection attack, this gate is your last line of defense.

`process` manages background processes — list tasks, check output, kill stuck processes. Usually enabled alongside `exec`.

### Web Access: web_search, web_fetch

`web_search` performs keyword searches, `web_fetch` reads web page content. Together, they let OpenClaw browse the internet for information.

---

## Layer 2: Advanced Capabilities (17 Tools)

Layer 1 is "can it work at all." Layer 2 is "does it work well." These Tools transform OpenClaw from a command executor into a real assistant — one that remembers your preferences, controls a browser, and sends scheduled notifications. But each additional Tool expands the attack surface, so evaluate whether the trade-off is worth it.

### Browser: browser, canvas, image

`browser` lets OpenClaw control Chrome — click buttons, fill forms, take screenshots. I use it for price comparisons, spec research, and adding items to shopping carts. But I always check out myself. The "last mile" involving payments never goes to AI — that's my line.

`canvas` is a visual workspace for diagrams and flowcharts. `image` lets OpenClaw "understand" images.

### Memory: memory_search, memory_get

Lets OpenClaw remember information across sessions. After a week of use, it knows I build blogs with Astro, deploy on Azure, and prefer Traditional Chinese — no need to re-explain every time. The longer you use it, the better it knows you.

### Multi-Session: sessions series (5 tools)

Run multiple sessions for different tasks simultaneously — one discussing a product idea, another researching travel plans, without interference.

`sessions_list` and `sessions_history` view sessions. `session_status` checks status. `sessions_send` and `sessions_spawn` enable inter-session communication and spawning sub-tasks.

### Messaging: message

Lets OpenClaw send messages to Discord, Slack, Telegram, WhatsApp, iMessage.

I have this enabled but only for sending messages to myself — never for communicating with others on my behalf. The reason is simple: messages sent in your name by AI can't be unsent. If it misunderstands the context, uses the wrong tone, or gets tricked by Prompt Injection into sending something, you bear the consequences.

I use OpenClaw as the communication layer for my <a href="/en/blog/ai-goal-management-system" target="_blank">AI goal management system</a> — enabling `message` lets it proactively push notifications to me: Daily Briefs, task reminders, and to-do alerts, all sent to myself.

### Hardware Control: nodes

Cross-device hardware control — remote screenshots, GPS location, camera access.

When I first saw this Tool, I asked myself: when would I need AI to open my camera on its own? I couldn't think of a scenario. For screenshots, I can just send one via Telegram — one extra step but much more peace of mind. Disabled.

### Automation: cron, gateway

`cron` sets up scheduled tasks. `gateway` lets OpenClaw restart itself.

Every morning at 6:47, my Telegram receives a Daily Brief prepared by OpenClaw — what I need to do today, pending messages to reply to, and the weather forecast. That's `cron` plus `message` in action, and it's the core of my <a href="/en/blog/ai-goal-management-system" target="_blank">AI goal management system</a>.

### Agent Communication: agents_list

Lists available Agent IDs. OpenClaw supports multi-agent architectures, but official docs don't go into detail. If you're running a single OpenClaw instance, you won't need this.

### Extension Tools: llm_task, lobster

`lobster` is a workflow engine for defining multi-step processes. `llm_task` inserts LLM processing steps into workflows.

If you're not using a workflow engine, skip both.

---

## Layer 3: Knowledge Layer (53 Official Skills)

53 sounds like a lot, but after scanning them you'll find maybe a dozen are relevant to you. The rest — food delivery, smart home, voice calls — aren't bad, just irrelevant if they don't match your use case.

**Important: bundled Skills auto-load by default** — if the corresponding CLI tool is installed on the system, the Skill activates automatically. It's not "nothing unless installed" but "everything unless disabled." To control which Skills are active, use `skills.allowBundled` in whitelist mode (config example in the "My Config" section below).

ClawHub has 3,000+ third-party Skills, but their security risks are a separate concern (see the <a href="/en/blog/2026-02-04-is-openclaw-safe-security-guide" target="_blank">security guide</a>).

Organized by use case below.

### Notes

4 note-taking Skills: `obsidian`, `notion`, `apple-notes`, `bear-notes`. Whether they work depends on your deployment.

`apple-notes` and `bear-notes` only work on Mac locally — if OpenClaw runs in a VM, they're out. `obsidian` operates on local files. I use Obsidian, but my vault is on my Mac while OpenClaw is on an Azure VM, so I handle notes with Claude Code locally rather than through OpenClaw. If you want OpenClaw to manage notes directly and it runs in a VM, `notion` is cloud-based with no deployment constraints — the path of least resistance.

### Productivity

Two email Skills: `gog` and `himalaya`. `gog` integrates the entire Google Workspace (Gmail, Calendar, Tasks, Drive, Docs, Sheets). `himalaya` uses IMAP/SMTP for sending and receiving only. If you're on Google, go with `gog` — more complete, and you can revoke access from your Google account anytime.

Task management has `things-mac` (Things 3), `apple-reminders`, and `trello`. If you already have `gog`, Google Tasks is included — no extra install needed.

### Messaging & Social Media

`wacli` (WhatsApp), `imsg` (iMessage), `bird` (X/Twitter), `slack`, `discord` — these Skills give OpenClaw deep access to each platform, including searching message history, syncing conversations, and managing channels. Unlike the `message` tool (which only sends messages), installing these gives it full access to your data on that platform.

I haven't installed any of them. The last step in external communication is always manual.

### Developer Tools

- `github`: Operates GitHub via `gh` CLI, requires OAuth, permissions are controllable
- `tmux`: Manages multiple terminal sessions
- `session-logs`: Searches and analyzes past conversation logs
- `coding-agent`: Calls other AI coding assistants (Codex, Claude Code, etc.) in the background

I have `github`, `tmux`, and `session-logs` installed. I write code locally with Claude Code, but OpenClaw is always reachable via Telegram — if CI/CD breaks while I'm out, I just ask "check why this PR build failed" on my phone, and it pulls the GitHub Actions error log and tells me the cause.

I haven't installed `coding-agent` yet, but the potential is significant — you could install Claude Code on OpenClaw's VM and let it dispatch coding tasks in the background. Imagine telling OpenClaw via Telegram: "I found this interesting repo on GitHub — clone it, study it, and build a demo site." It launches Claude Code, executes autonomously, and pushes a notification when done. AI orchestrating AI. I haven't explored this deeply yet, but it's on my list.

### Password Management

`1password` lets OpenClaw access your 1Password vault — look up passwords, auto-login, fill forms. Use cases like: "Log me into AWS Console" or "What's the password for this site?"

But the permission model is all-or-nothing: once authorized, it has access to the entire vault. You can't limit it to specific entries — whatever you've stored, it can read. I chose not to install it. If you really need this, consider creating an "AI-only vault" containing only passwords you're comfortable sharing with AI.

### Other Categories

The categories above are what I actively use or seriously considered. The rest — music playback, smart home, image generation, speech-to-text, food delivery — I haven't installed. Full list in the appendix.

## My OpenClaw Config: How I Set Up Tools and Skills

My OpenClaw runs on an Azure VM, operated via Telegram. Paired with Claude Code on desktop, it forms a mobile + desktop dual workflow — mobile for discussions, research, and capturing ideas anytime (conversation history syncs automatically), desktop for execution. I also use it daily for email, calendar, research, and the morning Daily Brief.

Here's my current config and the reasoning behind each choice.

### Tools (21 of 25 enabled)

My rule is simple: **if I can't think of a use case, it stays off.**

```json
{
  "tools": {
    "allow": [
      "read", "write", "edit", "apply_patch",
      "exec", "process",
      "web_search", "web_fetch",
      "browser", "image",
      "memory_search", "memory_get",
      "sessions_list", "sessions_history", "sessions_send", "sessions_spawn", "session_status",
      "message", "cron", "gateway", "agents_list"
    ],
    "deny": ["nodes", "canvas", "llm_task", "lobster"]
  },
  "approvals": {
    "exec": { "enabled": true }
  }
}
```

**21 enabled, 4 disabled**: `nodes` (can't think of a scenario), `canvas` (don't need it), `llm_task` / `lobster` (not using workflow engine). `exec` has approval enabled. `message` only sends to myself.

### Skills (9 of 53 enabled)

As mentioned earlier, bundled Skills auto-load by default. I use `allowBundled` whitelist to restrict to only what I need:

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "allowBundled": [
      "gog", "github", "tmux", "session-logs",
      "weather", "summarize", "clawhub",
      "healthcheck", "skill-creator"
    ]
  }
}
```

In short: `gog` for email and calendar, `github` for repos, and the rest are utilities for Daily Brief and system management.

## How to Automate Tasks with Your AI Agent

This is where OpenClaw stops being a chatbot and starts being infrastructure. The combination of `cron` (scheduling) and `message` (push notifications) turns it into an automation engine that works while you sleep.

The pattern is always the same: **trigger + action + deliver**. Define when it runs, what it does, and where results go. Here are the automations I actually use:

**Daily Brief** — Every morning at 6:47, my Telegram receives a briefing: today's calendar, pending emails that need replies, weather forecast, and any CI/CD failures overnight. This single automation replaced my habit of checking five different apps before coffee.

**Email Triage** — Twice a day, OpenClaw scans my inbox, categorizes messages by urgency, and sends me a summary. Newsletters get archived. Anything requiring action gets flagged with a one-line summary. I went from 30 minutes of inbox management to 5.

**CI/CD Monitoring** — When a GitHub Actions workflow fails, OpenClaw reads the error log, identifies the likely cause, and pushes a Telegram message with the diagnosis. I've fixed production issues from my phone while standing in line for coffee.

**Content Research** — Daily, OpenClaw collects trending discussions from specific subreddits, Hacker News threads, and RSS feeds I follow, then compiles a digest of potential writing topics. It doesn't write for me — it surfaces what's worth writing about.

The setup isn't complicated. Each automation is a `cron` entry that triggers a prompt, and the prompt tells OpenClaw which tools to use and where to send results. The hard part isn't the config — it's figuring out which parts of your routine are worth automating. Start with one that saves you the most daily friction, get it working, then add more.

---

## Next Steps: Start Configuring Your OpenClaw

You don't need all 25 Tools. The 53 bundled Skills default to all-on — use `allowBundled` to keep only what you need. Open your `openclaw.json` and start with three principles:

1. **If you can't think of a use case, leave it off**
2. **More capability, more control** — enable approval for `exec`, only message yourself
3. **The last mile is always manual** — checkout, sending messages, posting publicly — anything irreversible stays with you

My config above works as a starting point. Copy it, then trim to fit your needs. For security settings, read it alongside the <a href="/en/blog/2026-02-04-is-openclaw-safe-security-guide" target="_blank">security guide</a>.

OpenClaw is more than a tool for me — it's the infrastructure that lets one person do the work of a team. I believe in the age of AI, one person can build a company. I'm proving it with my own journey — from product development to growth marketing to life management, all solo. Every step of how I do it goes into my newsletter. <a href="/en/" target="_blank">Subscribe</a> and follow along.

## FAQ

### Do Skills change OpenClaw's permissions?

No. Skills are just instruction manuals. Actual capabilities are controlled by `tools.allow`.

### Can the 1password Skill read all my passwords?

Yes. Once authorized, it has access to your entire vault — whatever you've stored, it can read.

### How do I revoke OpenClaw's Google access?

<a href="https://myaccount.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Account</a> → Security → Third-party apps with account access → Find gog → Remove access.

### Are third-party Skills on ClawHub safe?

Don't assume they are. Always review the GitHub repo before installing. See the <a href="/en/blog/2026-02-04-is-openclaw-safe-security-guide" target="_blank">security guide</a> for a detailed review checklist and prompts.

### Why 25 Tools?

Official docs list 18. I found 25 by going through the codebase. The extras include session-related tools, `agents_list`, and workflow engine tools (`llm_task`, `lobster`) not documented.

### What's the difference between OpenClaw and ChatGPT?

ChatGPT is a chat tool. OpenClaw is an agent. The difference is what happens after the conversation:

- **ChatGPT**: After discussing, you manually copy content and paste it elsewhere. It can only talk.
- **OpenClaw**: After discussing, it acts — searches the web, reads and writes files, manages your calendar, reads your Gmail and drafts replies, syncs to your computer for Claude Code to pick up.

Even "sync" means different things: LLM apps sync means you see conversation history on phone and desktop. OpenClaw sync means conversations become files in your computer's folders that other tools can directly read and continue working with. One is "viewable." The other is "actionable."

If you just want to chat, ChatGPT is enough. If you want AI to keep working after the conversation ends, you need an agent like OpenClaw.

### How to automate tasks with AI using OpenClaw?

Combine `cron` (scheduling) and `message` (push notifications). OpenClaw runs tasks on a schedule and delivers results to your messaging platform. Every morning at 6:47, I receive a Daily Brief — today's tasks, pending replies, and the weather forecast.

Beyond scheduled push notifications, common automation scenarios include: email triage with priority summaries, CI/CD failure monitoring, scheduled collection of trending topics for writing material, and industry news digests. Basically, any task that can be broken into "trigger + steps" can be automated.

### Can I use OpenClaw without coding?

Day-to-day usage requires no coding — just talk to it in natural language. "Check my email for today," "Set a reminder for 9 AM tomorrow" — just say it.

But OpenClaw is an open-source project, and installation/configuration have a learning curve. You can deploy to a cloud VM or install locally — for security, a dedicated machine is recommended over your daily driver. If you use an AI CLI tool like Claude Code, it can assist with the setup process and save significant time.
