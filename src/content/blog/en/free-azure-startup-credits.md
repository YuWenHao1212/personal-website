When you're building a product solo, cost is the biggest concern. Cloud services, APIs, dev tools—everything costs money. You end up burning through cash before earning your first dollar.

But when I build products, I barely spend anything on infrastructure. Not because I don't use these services. Because someone else is paying for them.

## Microsoft for Startups

[Microsoft for Startups](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/startups) is Microsoft's resource program for early-stage founders. The key point: **indie developers can apply too.**

In July 2025, the program was restructured into two paths:

| Path | Azure Credits | Requirements |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| **Self-Service** | Up to $5,000 | New Azure user, complete Business Verification |
| **Investor-Backed** | $100,000+ | Referral code from investor or accelerator |

Most indie developers take the Self-Service path. If you have connections with investors or accelerators, the Investor-Backed path offers significantly more resources.

## What You Get

Self-Service credits come in two stages. First, you get $1,000 immediately after applying, valid for 90 days. Then, after completing Business Verification, you unlock an additional $4,000 valid for 180 days.

These credits work on all Azure services—Azure OpenAI Service, App Service, Blob Storage, databases, and more. For products still in development, $1,000 is actually plenty to get started.

## How to Apply

### Step 1: Get Your $1,000 Credits

1. Go to [Microsoft for Startups](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/startups)
2. Sign in with your Microsoft account (create one if needed)
3. Select "Start your free Azure trial"
4. Set up your Azure account
5. Credits are automatically applied to your Azure Sponsorship subscription

**Note**: You must be a new Azure user. If you already have an Azure subscription, you won't qualify.

### Step 2: Business Verification (Unlock $4,000)

Within 90 days of applying, you can complete Business Verification to unlock the additional $4,000. The process involves logging into Azure Portal, clicking the verification prompt, and providing your company address, business registration details, and a product description. No pitch deck needed—just a simple text description or a link to your website works fine. Review takes about 7 business days.

**Pro tip**: If you don't have a company yet, start with the $1,000 credits for development. Verify near the end of the 90 days. This way you maximize your runway: 90 + 180 = 270 days of credits.

Verification requires a registered legal entity. Government agencies, educational institutions, consulting firms, and cryptocurrency mining operations don't qualify.

## How I Use These Resources

I built [AI Resume Advisor](/en/products/ai-resume-advisor) using these resources. The backend runs on Container Apps with containerized APIs. Database is PostgreSQL with Redis for caching. AI analysis uses Azure OpenAI Service, PDF parsing uses Document Intelligence, and files are stored in Blob Storage.

So far, all these costs have been covered by credits.

## Things to Note

Watch the expiration dates carefully. The initial $1,000 lasts 90 days, and the verified $4,000 lasts 180 days. Once expired, they're gone—no extensions. So apply when you have a concrete product plan.

If you don't have a company yet, you have two options: start with $1,000 credits for development, or register a company to unlock the full amount. Next post, I'll cover how to register a US company.

## Conclusion

If you're building a product, this resource is worth applying for.
