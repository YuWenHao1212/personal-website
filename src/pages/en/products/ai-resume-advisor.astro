      <!-- The Story -->
      <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none mb-12">
        <h2>Three Hours vs Six Seconds</h2>
        <p>Three hours. That's how long you spend tweaking your resume. Adjusting wording, optimizing layout, making sure every keyword is in place.</p>
        <p>Six seconds. That's how long HR looks at your resume.</p>
        <p>Then? Radio silence.</p>
        <p>
          You tell yourself: the resume must not be good enough. So you revise it again, maybe even ask ChatGPT to polish it. Same result.
        </p>
        <p>I've seen this cycle too many times. But I started to wonder: <strong>Is the problem really about "writing"?</strong></p>

        <h2>Two Types of Gaps</h2>
        <p>There are actually two types of gaps between your resume and a job posting. Most people confuse them—and end up solving the wrong problem.</p>

        <h3>Presentation Gap: You have it, but didn't show it</h3>
        <p>You have the skill, but your resume doesn't convey it well.</p>
        <p>
          For example, say you're a PM. You've led cross-functional projects, but your resume only says "tracked project progress and coordinated with team members." That's too vague—an intern could write the same thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Try this instead: "Managed 5 cross-functional projects using Jira, coordinating teams across Taiwan, US, and India, improving on-time delivery rate from 70% to 95%."
        </p>
        <p>Same experience, completely different impact. In this case, AI writing tools can actually help.</p>

        <h3>Skill Gap: You really don't have it</h3>
        <p>You simply don't have that skill.</p>
        <p>
          A Data Scientist role requires deploying ML models to production—you've only run them in Jupyter Notebook. A PM role needs Agile/Scrum certification and Monte Carlo simulation for risk assessment—you've never touched these tools.
        </p>
        <p>No amount of polishing will help. You're missing the skill itself, not just the words.</p>

        <h2>Why Most Resume Tools Don't Work</h2>
        <p>
          Most resume tools—including asking ChatGPT to rewrite—only address the first problem. Polishing, keyword optimization, ATS formatting. These are fine, but they only solve half the problem.
        </p>
        <p>What about Skill Gaps? No one tells you.</p>
        <p>
          So you send 50 applications, get 2 responses. You think it's the wording, so you keep tweaking and applying. But the truth might be: you don't meet the core requirements of 80% of those jobs.
        </p>
        <p><strong>You keep polishing the key's appearance, not realizing it doesn't fit the lock.</strong></p>

        <h2>The Right Order: Diagnose First, Then Act</h2>
        <p>Traditional approach: Write resume → Apply → Wait → Rejected → Revise → Apply again</p>
        <p>The biggest problem? You never know what went wrong. Words? Skills? You can only guess.</p>
        <p>But what if you flipped the order?</p>
        <p><strong>Diagnose gaps → Understand what's missing → Decide whether to apply → Prepare strategically</strong></p>
        <p>
          Before applying, you know your odds. You know which skills you have, which you lack. For what's missing, you know how to fill the gap.
        </p>

        <h2>How AI Resume Advisor Helps</h2>
        <p><strong>Step 1: See your match score in 3 seconds</strong></p>
        <p>When browsing LinkedIn jobs, our browser extension shows your match score instantly. No guessing—numbers tell the truth.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Understand both types of gaps</strong></p>
        <p>Click for the full report (~30 seconds), and you'll see both gaps clearly separated:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Presentation Gap</strong>: You have it but didn't express well → AI helps rewrite</li>
          <li><strong>Skill Gap</strong>: You actually lack it → Recommended courses to fill the gap</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Build skills, not just polish words</strong></p>
        <p>For your Skill Gaps, we recommend online courses from Google, IBM, Meta, and top universities.</p>
        <p>Think of it like a skill tree in a game. You can see where you are, where you want to go, and what skills to unlock in between. Only this time, it's for your real career.</p>
