My normal site is in NYC, but during the holiday season I was asked (more realistically forced) to support a warehouse in New Jersey after their IT tech quit and wasn’t replaced. This turned into a 1.5-hour commute each way. Before this commute just to mention, I loved working at this job and it was very laid back. Of course pay could have always been better but peace of mind and the work/life balance was on par. \n\nI was told this assignment would only last through the end of December. When I later asked if I’d still be working there after that, my direct manager gave no clear answer and never followed up.\n\nKey points:\n\n\t•\tMy vacation was planned, requested, and approved months in advance, before I knew I’d be supporting the NJ site.\n\n\t•\tI worked the entire Thanksgiving weekend and had earned PTO denied due to “business needs.”\n\n\t•\tDuring the company’s mandated year-end shutdown, a P1 incident occurred and they expected me to drive to NJ anyway.\n\n\t•\tOnce I started working at the NJ location, the situation felt off, so I began applying to other jobs immediately.\n\nNow management is acting like I’m in the wrong for taking my pre-approved PTO, and another manager (not my direct manager) is implying I failed to communicate my time off—despite my direct manager knowing already.\n\nI’ve since accepted a new job offer and am waiting on the background check.\n\nAm I missing something here, or is this just poor management and planning?\n\nPS- I haven’t responded yet as I’m still on vacation enjoying myself and don’t want to stress myself out.

It was always \"You will have to ask the operating manager, it can vary.\" They said typically a Monday to Friday. \n\nI did the interview, and they said they wanted to offer the job to me. Then they told me the hours required. Keep in mind that no overtime pay is offered on the position.  They made sure that it was salary based even though I asked if I could be hourly. \n\nHours were 6AM to 5:30PM with the potential to be there later in the day. Also rotating Saturdays, and on those weeks you do 6 days a week. Average hours are around 55-65 a week for 65k a year. No overtime. I am a single dad, so i said with that many hours I would be stupid to be on salary. I turned down rhe offer, and they said I would not be a good fit because I am not available enough. \n\nIs this the expectation now? Do people expect you to work more for less? 65k for that many hours a week seems absurd.",

I knew I was short but I thought that because they selected me for an interview regardless, it wasn’t a hard and fast rule.\n\nThe email from HR mentioned: “I want to emphasize that the hiring team was very impressed with you and your qualifications. Your skills, professionalism, and potential stood out, and we would absolutely welcome the opportunity to reconnect with you once you meet the full experience requirement. We would be very interested in considering you in a future hiring round.”\n\nThat should make me feel better but I worry that because it is such a good position, the next time they will have a hiring round may be 3+ years.\n\nI wanted out of this town so badly and I’m so crushed but trying not to spiral (doing a terrible job). I could really use some encouragement from those of you who have been through this before.\n\nEdit: I was informed that because it is a [government job](https://www.governmentjobs.com/resources/details?resourceId=d9d9bc6b-c946-49ea-a38f-af80be9e0c8a) the minimum requirements are strict",

Situation, Task, Action, Result.\n\nAnd yeah, sure, structure is good. But here's the problem - interviewers have heard thousands of perfect STAR answers. They all sound the same. They're forgettable.\n\nWhat I noticed after getting feedback from several interviewers:\n\nWhat actually works:\n\n1. Tell stories where you made mistakes\n\nMy best-performing answers were ones where I admitted I did something wrong. Not major ethical violations, but stuff like \"I pushed back too hard on a decision and damaged a relationship with a PM\" or \"I underestimated the scope and missed a deadline.\"\n\nWhy it works: It's authentic. It shows self-awareness. And the \"what I learned\" part becomes actually meaningful.\n\n2. Use specific names and numbers\n\nBad: \"I worked with the design team to improve the feature.\"\n\nGood: \"I worked with Sarah, our lead designer, and we spent about 3 weeks iterating on the checkout flow. Conversion went from 2.1% to 3.4%.\"\n\nThe specificity makes it real. It proves you actually did this, not just making it up.\n\n3. Show the mess\n\nReal projects are messy. Stakeholders disagree. Timelines slip. Requirements change.\n\nWhen your story is too clean (\"We identified the problem, implemented a solution, got great results\"), it sounds fake.\n\nInclude the friction. \"Marketing wanted X but engineering said it wasn't possible with our timeline. I had to negotiate a middle ground that nobody was thrilled about, but we shipped on time.\"\n\n4. Prepare 5-6 stories, not 50\n\nI used to try to have a different story for every possible question.

I’ve been doing the work hands on (content creation, video, social media, marketing strategy, client communication), but I’m at a point where I know guidance from someone more experienced could save me years of trial and error.\n\nI’m not looking for shortcuts or handouts just honest advice, perspective, and accountability from someone who’s already built something real. I’m willing to put in the work, learn fast, and actually apply feedback.\n\nIf you’ve built a marketing agency, service based business, or scaled a company and are open to mentoring (even casually or occasionally), I’d really appreciate the opportunity to learn from you.\n\nIt doesn’t have to be someone specifically in the marketing or video industry I’d love to learn from anyone who’s had success building a business\n\nThanks in advance to anyone willing to share insight or point me in the right direction.",

The salary isn’t as great as I was hoping for, but it’s slightly better than my last job and is the exact role I was targeting. \n\nI just wanted to share my success to let others know that it is possible. I definitely felt hopeless at times even with 17 years of relevant experience. I tried all the tricks. I’m sure you’ve heard it all as well, but what helped me was:\n\n1. Networking - Networking has always been difficult for me. It’s not hard for me to connect with people, but it’s hard for me to feel/be authentic with professional networking. However what got me into my current role is someone I barely knew from 20 years ago. Knowing people in organizations gets you an easy interview. Even professional, brief, and genuine cold messages to recruiters on LinkedIn have gotten me interviews; maybe it shows initiative, maybe it puts your app at the top of the pile and gives it a memorable human touch. I’m not sure, but it can work.\n\n2. Tailoring resumes - Simply put, it improves ATS scans. I had done multiple industry versions and industry rewrites of my resume, but tailoring to specific job descriptions to hit on keywords helped me get past the initial screening to get more recruiter calls and interviews. The trick is to make it genuine so it doesn’t actually seem like you’re just stuffing arbitrary keywords in (even if you are). I’m not a huge fan of AI but it helps with the initial tedium and ideas though you need to refine the output.\n\n3. Authenticity - I’ve surfaced this in the other points, but I found this was especially important in interviews. Obviously, everyone in interviews is nervous to some extent or another, and we’re all trying to sell the best versions of ourselves. By and large though, interviewers know when you’re being fake or performing. It shouldn’t be a performance but a conversation. Unfortunately it can take some practice interviewing to get to that point. What helped",
