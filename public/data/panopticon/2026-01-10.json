      "selftext": "I spent the last year job searching (got laid off in the tech downturn) and did somewhere around 50-60 interviews before landing a role I'm happy with.\n\nThe technical stuff is its own beast, but I want to talk about behavioral interviews because I think most advice out there is actively harmful.\n\nThe standard advice is wrong\n\nEveryone says: Use STAR format. Situation, Task, Action, Result.\n\nAnd yeah, sure, structure is good. But here's the problem - interviewers have heard thousands of perfect STAR answers. They all sound the same. They're forgettable.\n\nWhat I noticed after getting feedback from several interviewers:\n\nWhat actually works:\n\n1. Tell stories where you made mistakes\n\nMy best-performing answers were ones where I admitted I did something wrong. Not major ethical violations, but stuff like \"I pushed back too hard on a decision and damaged a relationship with a PM\" or \"I underestimated the scope and missed a deadline.\"\n\nWhy it works: It's authentic. It shows self-awareness. And the \"what I learned\" part becomes actually meaningful.\n\n2. Use specific names and numbers\n\nBad: \"I worked with the design team to improve the feature.\"\n\nGood: \"I worked with Sarah, our lead designer, and we spent about 3 weeks iterating on the checkout flow. Conversion went from 2.1% to 3.4%.\"\n\nThe specificity makes it real. It proves you actually did this, not just making it up.\n\n3. Show the mess\n\nReal projects are messy. Stakeholders disagree. Timelines slip. Requirements change.\n\nWhen your story is too clean (\"We identified the problem, implemented a solution, got great results\"), it sounds fake.\n\nInclude the friction. \"Marketing wanted X but engineering said it wasn't possible with our timeline. I had to negotiate a middle ground that nobody was thrilled about, but we shipped on time.\"\n\n4. Prepare 5-6 stories, not 50\n\nI used to try to have a different story for every possible question. Impossible to remember and I'd always stumble.\n\nNow I have 5-6 really strong stories that I can",

I’m not trying to build the next Unicorn, just a sustainable tool.\n\nBut for the last month, I’ve been trapped in a loop that I can't seem to break: **Have Idea -&gt; Do Market Research -&gt; Find 3 massive competitors + 10 open source alternatives -&gt; Get discouraged -&gt; Scrap Idea.**\n\nI feel like I'm stuck in a \"procrastination cage.\" Here is exactly what keeps happening:\n\n1. **Idea:** I wanted to build an LLM Proxy/Gateway.\n   * *Reality Check:* I found LiteLLM, Helicone, Portkey, TrueFoundry. They are VC-backed, support 100+ providers, and move faster than I ever could as a solo dev. I felt like it was pointless to even start.\n2. **Idea:** A \"GummySearch\" alternative for Reddit to find pain points.\n   * *Reality Check:* The Reddit API is expensive/restrictive now, and the existing tools are already very polished.\n\nI know the standard advice is \"Competition is validation\" and \"Just niche down,\" but it’s hard to stay motivated when you feel like you’re just building a worse version of something that already exists.\n\n**My questions to those who have launched:**\n\n* How do you mentally get past the \"Big Competitor\" fear?\n* Do you deliberately build in \"Red Oceans\" (saturated markets), or do you keep digging until you find something totally new?\n* How do you find problems worth solving that aren't already solved by a massive SaaS with a free tier?\n\nI’m eager to build, but I feel paralyzed by research. Any advice on how to stop overthinking and just pick a lane would be appreciated.\n\nPS. Please don't write, don't make research, this part is very important.",

I was curious what I’d learn by looking at my own conversations aggregated over time who I talk to most, my tone shifts, late-night spirals, productivity bursts, etc. Turns out... it was way more interesting and a little confronting than I expected.\n\nNow I’m stuck at a classic Indie Hacker crossroads:\n\n*  Is this a standalone product people intentionally come back to a few times a year?\n* Or is this really a feature that belongs inside something else (journaling, productivity, CRM, mental health, etc.)?\n* And how do you design something that’s valuable without turning into creepy surveillance or data hoarding? \n\nI’m being extremely cautious around privacy (minimal storage, user-controlled data, no resale), but even then, trust feels like the entire product. Would love to hear from anyone who’s built:\n\n* Low-frequency but high-impact products\n* Reflection/insight tools rather than daily utilities\n* Or something that lives in that awkward “is this SaaS?” zone \n\nWhat would you want this to be and what would make you walk away immediately?

As it honestly just angers me how many people are being taken advantage of with low value \"make a website in 10 minutes' or make a website in 30 seconds with AI (literally a video on that).\n\nAs someone who has been in web design for nearly a decade I know for a fact that even the best AI website builder in the world will NEVER allow you to make a website in a few minutes let alone 10.\n\nThere is so much more that goes into a website than just getting some hyped up AI software to throw together a website for you.\n\nThese tutorials make things look far easier than it is and never go into anything past basic 'here's how to edit a few things around'.\n\nNo mention of UX, copywriting, SEO, setting up a custom domain, SSL certificates, menus, pages, contact forms etc.\n\nAnd so thats what I wanted to do different.\n\nAnd so I set out to create the most valuable Wordpress website tutorial I could and didn't hold back.\n\nIts 2 hours and 42 minutes long and goes deep.

Heres a quck overview of what I teach:\n\n\\- Setting up hosting and why I recommend cloudways  \n\\- Installing and walking through website properly  \n\\- Setting up and installing Elementor (easily the best drag and drop builder by far; it has some quirks like they all do but its phenomenal once you know what you're doing)  \n\\- W",

That is why engaged or married men often get flirted with.\n\nIf you’re competing in a noisy market, restraint shouldn’t be an accident. It should be the strategy. Most brands lose because they try to say everything, build everything, and appeal to everyone. Deliberate omission is often the faster path to clarity.\n\nMaking your customers feel superior by giving them something they don’t think they can get. The exclusivity they feel is what makes them come back.\n\nPick one promise and enforce it ruthlessly. Remove features that dilute it. Kill marketing messages that don’t reinforce it. Say no publicly and consistently. Restraint works because it forces focus, and focus reads as confidence.\n\nBut this is risky. A brand can seem arrogant and lose value. Sometimes founders mistake minimalism for laziness. Cutting without raising the bar elsewhere doesn’t signal exclusivity or premium. It signals weakness. The standard must rise as the surface area shrinks.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is that most competitors can’t copy restraint even if they want to. It requires discipline, internal alignment, and the willingness to disappoint some customers. That’s why it works.\n\nIf your brand feels generic, the fix is rarely add more. It is usually decide harder.",

      "selftext": "After 11 months, 760 applications, and 25 interviews, I finally got a job offer. The salary isn’t as great as I was hoping for, but it’s slightly better than my last job and is the exact role I was targeting. \n\nI just wanted to share my success to let others know that it is possible. I definitely felt hopeless at times even with 17 years of relevant experience. I tried all the tricks. I’m sure you’ve heard it all as well, but what helped me was:\n\n1. Networking - Networking has always been difficult for me. It’s not hard for me to connect with people, but it’s hard for me to feel/be authentic with professional networking. However what got me into my current role is someone I barely knew from 20 years ago. Knowing people in organizations gets you an easy interview. Even professional, brief, and genuine cold messages to recruiters on LinkedIn have gotten me interviews; maybe it shows initiative, maybe it puts your app at the top of the pile and gives it a memorable human touch. I’m not sure, but it can work.\n\n2. Tailoring resumes - Simply put, it improves ATS scans. I had done multiple industry versions and industry rewrites of my resume, but tailoring to specific job descriptions to hit on keywords helped me get past the initial screening to get more recruiter calls and interviews. The trick is to make it genuine so it doesn’t actually seem like you’re just stuffing arbitrary keywords in (even if you are). I’m not a huge fan of AI but it helps with the initial tedium and ideas though you need to refine the output.\n\n3. Authenticity - I’ve surfaced this in the other points, but I found this was especially important in interviews. Obviously, everyone in interviews is nervous to some extent or another, and we’re all trying to sell the best versions of ourselves. By and large though, interviewers know when you’re being fake or performing. It shouldn’t be a performance but a conversation.
